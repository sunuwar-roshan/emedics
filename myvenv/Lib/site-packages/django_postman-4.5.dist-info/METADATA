# Django Postman

This is an application for the Django web framework.

It provides a messaging functionality, mainly for a User-to-User exchange,
and with these convenient features:
* A non-User (email is undisclosed) can write to a User and get a reply
  (can be disabled by configuration)
* Exchanges can be moderated (with auto-accept and auto-reject plug-ins)
* Optional recipient filter plug-ins
* Optional exchange filtering plug-ins (blacklists)
* Multi-recipient writing is possible (can be disabled by configuration)
  with min/max constraints
* Messages are managed by conversations
* Messages in folders are sortable by sender|recipient|subject|date
* 'Archives' folder in addition to classic Inbox, Sent and Trash folders
* A Quick-Reply form to only ask for a response text
* A cleanup management command to clear the old deleted messages

It has support for optional additional applications:
* Autocomplete recipient field (default is 'django-ajax-selects'),
  with multiple recipient management
* New-message notification (default is 'pinax-notifications')
* Asynchronous mailer (default is 'django-mailer')

See the `docs/` directory for Sphinx documentation.
For example, build the HTML version with `>make html`
and open `docs/_build/html/index.html` or consult [ReadTheDocs](https://django-postman.readthedocs.io).
